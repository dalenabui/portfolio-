          <h3>A little about me</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          From a very young age, I've always been passionate about telling stories as well as creating things from scratch. In high school, one of the things I like to do in my spare time was to perfect and master the skills of "paper folding" or Origami. I found enjoyment in making handmade craft gifts for friends and family.
          <br>
          My educational background includes a BA in business and finance which has taught me the importance of marketing and an understanding of the brand's identity. Throughout my studies, I was able to concede techniques in analysing and understanding consumer populations, market segmentation and demographically diverse consumer behaviour. This made me realise that I enjoy examining the connections between individuals while helping people create meaningful experiences.
          <br>
          Throughout my experience as a Financial Advisor, one of the most important skills was to understand the client’s needs and research on the side strategy that best fits their circumstance. I love the challenge of problem-solving and working with different people to come up with an optimal solution.
          <br>
          I realised the power of storytelling most profoundly as a Financial Adviser. To have an optimal plan for my clients, I had to understand their end goal by crafting meaningful questions. Tailoring each client’s plan required looking at each individual circumstance and not as a whole. Thus, above all, I had to harness the emotion of deeply personal stories - stories to support my recommendation.
          <br>
          In 2018, after relocating to the United States from Australia, I discovered the field of UX. My childhood passion for design told me to take the chance. Thus, with all my experiences and as an advocate - for families, for the environment, for deep listening and heartfelt conversations - with me, I can’t wait to help you tell your story through design.
